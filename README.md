  ## Description:
      Welcome to challenge 13 ORM "Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End". As stated in the title, this is a backend project that uses MYSQL Sequelize and Express. We were tasked with building a functional database using Sequelize that uses Api routes to create, read, update, and delete or "C.R.U.D" for short. While this is n extensive time consuming project to build, when it finished you walk away with a lot of knowledge of on how databases work and are wired as well as how to write API routes.
